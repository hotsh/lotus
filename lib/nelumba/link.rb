    #                 search engine at "http://search.example.com" might
    #                 contain, as a link of Feed, a related link to that

    #                 resource.
    #   "enclosure" = Signifies that the URL in href identifies a related

    #   "via"       = Signifies that the URL in href identifies a resource that
    #                 is the source of the information provided in the
    #                 containing element.
    attr_reader :rel

    # Advises to the content MIME type of the linked resource.
    attr_reader :type

    # Advises to the language of the linked resource. When used with

    attr_reader :hreflang

    # Conveys human-readable information about the linked resource.
    attr_reader :title

    # Advises the length of the linked content in number of bytes. It is simply
    # a hint about the length based upon prior information. It may change, and
    # cannot override the actual content length.
