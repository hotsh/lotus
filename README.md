# Nelumba

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hotsh/nelumba.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hotsh/nelumba)

This gem implements federated protocols which let your website connect and interact with any website implementing a federated space.
Users of a federated service can communicate, produce and consume with users of all sites within that federation as one large community while also allowing them
to host such websites on their own servers or choice of hosting provider.
Specifically, this gem deals with handling the data streams and the technologies that are related to Nelumba/pump.io such as ActivityStreams, PortableContacts, Webfinger, PubSubHubbub, and Salmon.

One such application of this library (in its older form) is [rstat.us](https://rstat.us), which is a Twitter-like service that you can host yourself.

```
require 'nelumba'

author = Nelumba::Person.new(:uri   => "https://rstat.us/users/wilkie",
                             :email => "wilkie@xomb.org",
                             :name  => "wilkie")

## TODO

* General cleanup and abstraction of elements of Atom et al that aren't very consistent or useful.
* Add a persistence layer and allow this to be mixed with Rails and Sinatra style models.
* Add rails/sinatra aides to allow rapid development of Nelumba powered websites.
* Add already written osub/opub functionality to allow this gem to subscribe directly to other Nelumba powered websites.
* Add Webfinger user identity and verification written in the Salmon library and pull the remaining logic out of rstat.us.
* Add JSON backend.
* Write a PuSH hub to aid in small-scale deployment. (Possibly as a detached project. Nelumba talks to the hub via a socket.)
